This is not a course on Modern JS, however, it is useful to learn a few things
before diving too far into the React/Gatsby code. Some of this may be review if
you have worked on modern JavaScript projects. However, if you haven't, then
some of this syntax is going to look strange and possibly confusing.

Don't worry if you don't fully understand the syntax yet, you will pick it up
as we go through the rest of the training. If you still don't understand some
of these concepts after the training is completed, you may want to do some
additional research/training on modern JS until you are more familiar with the
syntax.
