One of the core problems with Gatsby and using Drupal as a backend is the
editorial experience. Gatsby live preview helps solve the common site editor
problem of allowing the editor to see the content before it is deployed on
the live website.

The two videos below walk through setting up Gatsby Live Preview. The first
covers using Gatsby Cloud Preview service (a paid service with a free trial
option). The second video covers setting up Gatsby Live Preview on a locally
running Gatsby Development server.
