When developing your Gatsby website workflow, you need to come up with a way to
deploy your content changes from your Drupal website. You could manually rebuild
the site each time, but that defeats the purpose of having a CMS.

Enter the [Drupal Build Hooks Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/build_hooks).
This module can be used to automatically trigger your Gatsby site to rebuild when
your content changes. There are a ton of configuration options. To see it in
action, watch the YouTube video below:
