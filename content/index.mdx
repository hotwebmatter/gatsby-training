Welcome to the Create Blazing Fast Websites with Gatsby and Drupal training.
Before you jump in, here are some notes and conventions that will help you along
the way.

## Get the Git Repo

You can download the entire Git repo for this training at:

[Gatsby Training Project](https://github.com/smthomas/gatsby-training-project)

Or just copy this command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/smthomas/gatsby-training-project
```

## Code along with me

All code you will need to type will look like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
```

If there are lines that need to be removed, they will be highlighted in red
while additions are highlighted in green.

```javascript
- const data = ['1','2'];
+ const data = [1,2];
```

## Checkpoints

**CHECKPOINT:** All checkpoints will be marked like this. This means this is a point where
you can checkout this branch from Github. This is useful if you fall behind and
want to catch up. Keep in mind you will lose any of your custom changes so this
is best used as reference.

## Challenges

**CHALLENGE:** All challenges are marked in this format. This means it is
something you will try to complete on your own. Don't worry, after you have some
time to try it out, we will go over it all together.
