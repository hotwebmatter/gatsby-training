When you run the `gatsby develop` command and it completes, you will see a link
to your locally running `graphiQL` instance. You can get to it by going to
`http://localhost:8000/___graphql` in your browser.

**Challenge:** Play around with GraphiQL and see what kind of data currently
exists in your Gatsby site.

Gatsby uses different source plugins to allow you to query different types
of data from various sources. We will mainly be focusing on pulling data
from Drupal and the local filesystem.
