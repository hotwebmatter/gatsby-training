So you want to learn a little bit about Gatsby and Drupal, huh? Well, you have come to the right place!

# Training Overview
Today we will learn the basics of Gatsby. You will get a chance to work with a
few Gatsby projects utilizing Drupal as your content data source. The goal is
for everyone to build and deploy a live Gatsby site by the end of the training.

Here are the things we will be learning more about:
- Introduction to GatsbyJS
- Introduction to React and GraphQL
- Modern JS overview
- Gatsby Build Blocks
- Styles in Gatsby
- Components / Layout Components
- Data in Gatsby
- Gatsby Source Plugins
- Utilizing Drupal Data in Gatsby
- Building blog and portfolio features
- Deploying your Site to Netlify
- Building a Contact Form with Netlify
- Drupal Live Preview
- Pagination in Gatsby
- Deploying Content Changes with Drupal Build Hooks
- Dynamic Content with Gatsby

# Who Are You?
Hopefully someone with some Drupal experience that has heard about this Gatsby
thing and wants to learn more. You may have some experience with Modern JS and
React, but it's not required. We will cover a bit of it in the beginning, but
you may need to do some additional learning on your own after the training to
help you fully understand the code we will be writing today.

# What Do you Need?
- A Drupal 8 site (Pantheon is a good option to spin one up)
- A Gatsby development environment, this can be local, in a Docker container, or using
CodeSandbox (though you might run into some problems using this last one)
